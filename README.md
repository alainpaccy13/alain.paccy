# Database Management System

## Overview
This database management system is designed to handle customer orders, products, and order details. It consists of four primary tables: **Customers**, **Orders**, **Products**, and **OrderDetails**. The database supports operations such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting data, as well as performing joins and subqueries to retrieve related information.

## Tables

### 1. Customers
- **Description**: Stores customer information.
- **Columns**:
  - `CustomerID`: Unique identifier for each customer (Primary Key).
  - `CustomerName`: Name of the customer.
  - `Contact`: Contact information of the customer.

### 2. Orders
- **Description**: Stores order details for each customer.
- **Columns**:
  - `OrderID`: Unique identifier for each order (Primary Key).
  - `CustomerID`: References the customer who placed the order (Foreign Key).
  - `OrderDate`: Date when the order was placed.

### 3. Products
- **Description**: Stores information about products available for sale.
- **Columns**:
  - `ProductID`: Unique identifier for each product (Primary Key).
  - `ProductName`: Name of the product.
  - `Price`: Price of the product.

### 4. OrderDetails
- **Description**: Stores details about products in each order.
- **Columns**:
  - `OrderID`: References the order (Foreign Key).
  - `ProductID`: References the product (Foreign Key).
  - `Quantity`: Number of units of the product ordered.
- **Primary Key**: Combination of `OrderID` and `ProductID`.

## SQL Commands

### Data Definition Language (DDL)
- **Create Tables**:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Customers (...);
    CREATE TABLE Orders (...);
    CREATE TABLE Products (...);
    CREATE TABLE OrderDetails (...);
    ```

### Data Manipulation Language (DML)
- **Insert Data**:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerID, CustomerName, Contact) VALUES (...);
    INSERT INTO Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate) VALUES (...);
    INSERT INTO Products (ProductID, ProductName, Price) VALUES (...);
    INSERT INTO OrderDetails (OrderID, ProductID, Quantity) VALUES (...);
    ```
- **Update Data**:
    ```sql
    UPDATE Customers SET Contact = 'new_email@example.com' WHERE CustomerID = 1;
    UPDATE Products SET Price = 899.99 WHERE ProductID = 1;
    ```
- **Delete Data**:
    ```sql
    DELETE FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = 5;
    DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID = 2;
    ```

### Data Control Language (DCL)
- **Grant Permissions**:
    ```sql
    GRANT SELECT ON Customers TO user_example;
    ```
- **Revoke Permissions**:
    ```sql
    REVOKE SELECT ON Customers FROM user_example;
    ```

### Transaction Control Language (TCL)
- **Commit Changes**:
    ```sql
    COMMIT;
    ```
- **Rollback Changes**:
    ```sql
    ROLLBACK;
    ```

### Joins and Subqueries
- **Inner Join**:
    ```sql
    SELECT O.OrderID, C.CustomerName, O.OrderDate
    FROM Orders O
    INNER JOIN Customers C ON O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID;
    ```
- **Subquery**:
    ```sql
    SELECT CustomerName
    FROM Customers
    WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
    ```

## Usage
